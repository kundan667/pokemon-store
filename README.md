1. Pokemon can be searched based on type and further by their names
2. On click of detail button on each card, one can see all the details of pokemon
3. Every card has its color derived from it's pokemon.
4. This application uses next router, tailwind, custom hooks, dynamic routing

## Application setup process
This application is built on node 20.12.2 and npm 10.5.0
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/kundan667/pokemon-store.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd pokemon-store `
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
4. Start the application using `npm run dev`
5. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
